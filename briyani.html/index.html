    <h1>WHAT IS BRIYANI?</h1>
    <p>
        Biryani is a delicious and aromatic dish that hails from the Mughal empire in the Indian subcontinent. 
        <br> It is a rice pilaf cooked with various spices, meat or fish, and <br> 
        vegetables.

        Debates about the "right" way to make biryani, or the "best" type of biryani are truly endless. <br>
        Indian vs Pakistani, Hyderabadi vs Karachi, dum biryani vs marinated biryani, <br>
        tomatoes or no tomatoes, potatoes or not potatoes. We can go on and on and on. But <br>
        the simple fact is that the beauty of biryani lies in this diversity of flavors, textures, and <br>
        methods. Each rendition is special in its own way.</p>
